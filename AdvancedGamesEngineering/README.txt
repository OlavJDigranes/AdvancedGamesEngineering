USAGE OF THE PLANETARY SYSTEM SIMULATOR:
    - When you run the executable (AdvancedGamesEngineering.exe) you will see a green menu with 4 input fields requireing inputs. The four
      fields represent the four initial aims in the rubrik. Using these parameters a planetary system is
      generated using simple physics calculations for gravitational pull and velocities of planets and moons. 
      BE AWARE, NO INPUT DELIMITERS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. 
        - The first field should be limited to between 20 and 60 as this is the range of test values.
          - Values up to 100 can be used, however that is not fully tested for integration. 
        - The second can only handle an input between 1 and 360.
        - The third MUST be kept between 1 and 10 as this is converted to a value between 0 adn 1. 
        - The last field can accept as big a number as you want to input. 
    - Click start to run the simulation. 

    - In the simulation scene: For the star/first camera use W/A/S/D to move along te x and z axis, and
      zoom using the scroll wheel on your mouse. Change cameras using the T and G keys on your keyboard.
      T goes further away from the star, G goes closer to it. All other cameras do not have the movement
      but they all have the zoom functionlaity. Press ESC in the simulation scene to quit the program.
